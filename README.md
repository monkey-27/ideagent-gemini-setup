**Agentic Quality-Diversity Search for Research Idea Generation**

An agentic quality-diversity (QD) search system for generating research ideas,
plus baseline generation methods used for comparison.

## 📖 Abstract

> Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly automated the process of scientific
> discovery over the past few years. However, existing systems share one core limitation:
> they generate and optimize ideas independently for either Quality or Diversity. This
> often leads to the generation of ideas in close proximity to one another or to a large
> set of trivial, unsound, or unclear concepts. In this work, we instead argue that
> research ideation should be treated as a conjunction of both objectives and framed as a
> Quality-Diversity (QD) search. In line with this perspective, we introduce IDEAgent, a
> multi-agent framework that manages the evolution of ideas through lineages. We jointly
> drive Quality using multi-objective feedback for dedicated repair and refinement, while
> Diversity is achieved through lightweight sequential memory and explicit comparison
> against completed ideas, their historical ancestors, and rejected proposals. To
> systematically evaluate this QD conjunction, we develop Yield, a joint metric that
> computes the largest set of mutually diverse ideas that satisfy a predetermined quality
> threshold. Finally, through evaluations across 32 topics spanning 8 domains of Computer
> Science, we show that IDEAgent outperforms the best baseline by 3.89x on Yield, while
> achieving non-zero Yield on 8x more topics. We further corroborate these findings
> through an analysis of quality improvements, showing that repair and refinement are
> crucial for building logical rigor and clarity while preserving non-obviousness.

## ⚙️ Setup

```bash
pip install -e .
```

Set the relevant API keys as environment variables or in a `.env` file
(`OPENAI_API_KEY`, `GEMINI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` — see `ideagent/clients.py`).

### OpenCode backend

To route calls through OpenCode instead of setting provider API keys in IDEAgent, use
the one-command wrapper:

```bash
python scripts/run_ideagent_opencode.py
```

The wrapper reuses OpenCode if it is already listening at `localhost:4096`; otherwise it
opens the OpenCode TUI first so you can choose the model from `/models` or the model
dropdown. After you select the model, quit OpenCode and the wrapper starts
`opencode serve --port 4096`, waits for it, runs IDEAgent, and shuts down the server it
launched. It uses:

```bash
python scripts/run_ideagent.py --config configs/ideagent_opencode_smoke.yaml
```

The OpenCode config omits `agents.*.model_id`, so OpenCode uses the model selected in
its interface/config. To skip the model picker and use OpenCode's saved/default model:

```bash
python scripts/run_ideagent_opencode.py --skip-model-picker
```

## 🚀 Run IDEAgent (main system)

```bash
python scripts/run_ideagent.py --config configs/ideagent.yaml
```

## 🧪 Run a Baseline

```bash
# Stateless-independent or single-shot batch
python baselines/simple/run_simple_baseline.py --config baselines/simple/stateless.yaml
python baselines/simple/run_simple_baseline.py --config baselines/simple/single_shot.yaml

# Sequential-memory
python baselines/simple/sequential_memory.py --config baselines/simple/sequential_memory.yaml

# NOVA closed-book
python baselines/nova/run_nova_closed_book.py --config baselines/nova/nova_closed_book.yaml
```

## 📊 Evaluate

Runs both quality and diversity eval in one command:

```bash
python scripts/eval_ideas.py \
    --config configs/comp_quality_eval_opus47.yaml configs/diversity_eval_opus47.yaml \
    --input <final_idea_cores.jsonl> \
    --quality-output <quality_report.jsonl> \
    --diversity-output <diversity_report.jsonl> \
    --resume
```

Pass `--skip-quality` or `--skip-diversity` to run only one half. `--start-idx`/
`--end-idx` slice the topic list for sharding a run. `--max-workers` overrides
both evaluators' concurrency.

## 🏆 Results

Mean Yield across 32 topics spanning 8 CS domains. Yield(τ) is the size of the
largest mutually-diverse (pairwise diversity ≥ 7) subset of an archive that is
simultaneously sound (≥ 7), clear (≥ 6), and non-obvious (≥ τ); Yield(τ=7) is the
primary metric reported in the paper.

| Method                 | Yield (τ=7, primary) | Yield (τ=6) |
| ----------------------- | :-------------------: | :----------: |
| **IDEAgent (ours)**     | **1.09**               | **2.31**     |
| NOVA Closed-Book        | 0.28                   | 1.16         |
| Stateless-Independent   | 0.25                   | 0.81         |
| Sequential-Memory       | 0.19                   | 0.53         |
| Single-Shot Batch       | 0.00                   | 0.00         |

IDEAgent outperforms the best baseline (NOVA) by **3.89×** on Yield(τ=7).

## 💡 Examples

`data/examples/` holds sample generations from IDEAgent and every baseline, one
JSONL file per method, over the same fixed set of topics for direct comparison.
